## background
Peter has been messing about with.computers pretty constantly for 47 years now.

He has found that a GitHub repository works well as keep notes about
- the computer technology he is using
- how and why he set it up, or is considering setting it up

This repository has those notes.  The repository is public, so the notes can be shared with others at CEB, without requiring them to get a GitHub account, and request access.

## people
This repository is intended to be shared with all at CEB.  

This repository is public, so we must take care to keep private information elsewhere.

## private information
* Peter keeps private notes about his use of computer technology in [duckspot study lounge](https://github.com/duckspot/study-lounge) (GitHub) - and there are frequent links between his private notes and notes in this repository.
